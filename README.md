# ZooDoc

## DESCRIPTION

ZooDoc is a website that allows users to find and rate veterinarians in their metro areas. Users may create accounts, log in, and read, rate, update, and delete vet reviews. Users must be autheniticated to perform any action other than read.

A typical experience would see a user create an account from a link on the home page, then return to the homepage where they could then log in with the new credentials. From the same page, the user would then enter their home metro area (currently, only New York and Philadelphia are supported) and be directed to a page listing doctors with practices in that area. The user would then be able to view information about the doctor, their contact information, and any reviews left by other users. The user would also be able to create, edit, and delete reviews of their own.

## CURRENT FEATURES

- Create an account
- Log in to the website

## PLANNED FEATURES
